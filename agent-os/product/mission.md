# Product Mission

## Problem

Developers need a memorable way to showcase their professional presence and connect with fellow tech professionals. Generic portfolio templates don't capture personality or technical creativity.

## Target Users

Fellow developers and tech professionals who appreciate creative, retro-inspired design and technical craftsmanship.

## Solution

A distinctive retro terminal-themed portfolio website inspired by classic sci-fi interfaces (Alien's Weyland-Yutani, Fallout). Features an immersive boot sequence for "Pb.OS version 2026.1" from the Chumbo Corporation, creating a memorable first impression that demonstrates both technical skill and creative vision.

The site provides keyboard-driven navigation (arrow keys + enter) alongside traditional mouse interaction, offering an authentic terminal experience while remaining accessible and user-friendly.
